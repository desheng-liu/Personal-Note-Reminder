# Personal Note Reminder
## By: Desheng Liu

Hi! 

* This is a personal-note-reminder personal project. This application can be used to make any personal messages you want
to keep track of. The notes will be stored on the personal account you make, so your notes will not be made public and 
private to only you.

* Make sure to keep track of your password and what respective email you use for it.

* To run this program, make sure to install Flask as well as its required modules by running: "pip install flask", "pip install flask-login", and lastly for the database, "pip install flask-sqlalchemy" and you should be good to go! I used python 3.9 to run this application.

***
* I built this project using Python and Flask, a common lightweight backend framework for Python.
* For the database, I used SQLAlchemy.
* This was my first time doing a primarily backend application, with some light design using HTML and some boostrap templating. Thanks!
* Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
